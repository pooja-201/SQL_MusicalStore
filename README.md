üìä Key SQL Queries / Insights Extracted
üéØ Question Set 1 ‚Äì Easy

**Senior most employee based on job title**

SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY levels DESC LIMIT 1;
Countries with the most invoices
SELECT billing_country, COUNT(*) AS total_invoices FROM invoice GROUP BY billing_country ORDER BY total_invoices DESC;
Top 3 invoice totals
SELECT total FROM invoice ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 3;
City with highest invoice total
SELECT billing_city, SUM(total) AS total_revenue FROM invoice GROUP BY billing_city ORDER BY total_revenue DESC LIMIT 1;

**Best customer (most money spent)**

SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, SUM(i.total) AS total_spent 
FROM customer c 
JOIN invoice i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id 
GROUP BY c.customer_id 
ORDER BY total_spent DESC 
LIMIT 1;

üß† Question Set 2 ‚Äì Moderate

**Emails of Rock music listeners**

SELECT DISTINCT c.email, c.first_name, c.last_name 
FROM customer c 
JOIN invoice i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id 
JOIN invoice_line il ON i.invoice_id = il.invoice_id 
JOIN track t ON il.track_id = t.track_id 
JOIN genre g ON t.genre_id = g.genre_id 
WHERE g.name = 'Rock' 
ORDER BY c.email;

**Top 10 rock bands by track count**

SELECT ar.name AS artist, COUNT(*) AS track_count 
FROM artist ar 
JOIN album al ON ar.artist_id = al.artist_id 
JOIN track t ON al.album_id = t.album_id 
JOIN genre g ON t.genre_id = g.genre_id 
WHERE g.name = 'Rock' 
GROUP BY ar.name 
ORDER BY track_count DESC 
LIMIT 10;

**Tracks longer than average length**

SELECT name, milliseconds 
FROM track 
WHERE milliseconds > (SELECT AVG(milliseconds) FROM track) 
ORDER BY milliseconds DESC;

üîç Question Set 3 ‚Äì Advanced

**Amount spent by each customer on artists**

SELECT c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS customer, ar.name AS artist, SUM(il.unit_price * il.quantity) AS total_spent 
FROM invoice i 
JOIN customer c ON i.customer_id = c.customer_id 
JOIN invoice_line il ON i.invoice_id = il.invoice_id 
JOIN track t ON il.track_id = t.track_id 
JOIN album al ON t.album_id = al.album_id 
JOIN artist ar ON al.artist_id = ar.artist_id 
GROUP BY customer, ar.name 
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

**Most popular genre by country**

WITH genre_country AS (
  SELECT c.country, g.name AS genre, COUNT(*) AS purchases 
  FROM customer c 
  JOIN invoice i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id 
  JOIN invoice_line il ON i.invoice_id = il.invoice_id 
  JOIN track t ON il.track_id = t.track_id 
  JOIN genre g ON t.genre_id = g.genre_id 
  GROUP BY c.country, g.name
), ranked AS (
  SELECT *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY purchases DESC) AS rnk 
  FROM genre_country
)
SELECT country, genre, purchases 
FROM ranked 
WHERE rnk = 1;

**Top customer per country by spend**

WITH customer_country AS (
  SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.country, SUM(i.total) AS total_spent 
  FROM customer c 
  JOIN invoice i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id 
  GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.country
), ranked AS (
  SELECT *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY total_spent DESC) AS rnk 
  FROM customer_country
)
SELECT country, first_name, last_name, total_spent 
FROM ranked 
WHERE rnk = 1;
